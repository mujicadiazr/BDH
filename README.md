# BDH
The proposed solution includes the creation of two sub-modules under architecture client / server and an application layer protocol on the OSI model to achieve the communication. The BDH-Server submodule obtains component information Collector via Ethernet, the locally stored efficiently, and It provided under the protocol referred to all system components may be consulted as is the case submodule BDH-Client, which can obtain information both in real time, as historically persisted, which It is shown in trend graphs to be analyzed. The solution They were performed developed a set of acceptance and performance testing; the results of these tests showed that the system performs the task so efficient and meet customer expectations of the solution.
